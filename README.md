## Overview

This unofficial documentation is for developers who want to experiment with
modifying gateware or firmware for Precursor using its JTAG debug port.

### Why might you want to modify Precursor?

Precursor is for developers who want the security benefits of being able to
audit and modify low-level design features that, in other system architectures,
would be etched in silicon, buried in epoxy, and hidden behind NDAs.

Mobile devices commonly use tightly integrated System on Chip (SoC) modules to
reduce the cost, size, and power consumption of incorporating many peripherals
and CPU cores into a design. One disadvantage of SoC-based designs is that you
cannot modify the silicon to fix security flaws. Also, writing firmware is
often complicated by the inclusion of proprietary technology with documentation
restricted behind a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

Precursor takes a different approach by using Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) chips instead of SoC modules. Implementing peripherals and CPU cores
with programmable gates inside an FPGA provides increased transparency into
details of the design. Also, with FPGAs, CPU design flaws can be corrected by
updating the FPGA with new gateware.

### How is gateware different from firmware?

Gateware is code that can configure an FPGA to act like a CPU core. Firmware is
code that can run on top of such a CPU core.

With an FPGA, low-level features can be changed in ways that would otherwise
require replacing etched silicon by physically swapping a chip for one with a
different design. When an FPGA powers up, it loads gateware to configure its
behavior. Changing the gateware is like etching new silicon and swapping the
chip, but with far less hassle and expense.

### What's the JTAG debug port about?

The JTAG interface allows for reprogramming Precursor's gateware and firmware
without any dependency on a bootloader or OS update service. JTAG is good for
changing low-level features.

Typical mobile or embedded products come with a bootloader or update service
that can overwrite some of the device's flash memory to install firmware
updates. But, how does the bootloader get programmed into flash to begin with?
In Precursor's case, JTAG can solve that problem, among others.

### Why does Precursor have more than one FPGA?

Short answer: Spliting features between two FPGAs helps to save power and
provide physical separation of device features into trusted and untrusted
security domains.

Medium answer: The goal is to use a low-power Lattice iCE40UP5K in the
untrusted domain to listen for incoming traffic and filter out irrelevant
packets. If successful, that will allow the power hungry XC7S50 (Xilinx Spartan
7) to spend most of its time in a deep low power mode. The trusted domain needs
the Spartan 7 to provide enough capacity for compute intensive encrypted chat
protocols. The Spartan 7 also has electrical control over the keyboard and
display to keep them isolated from the radio module.

Long answer: Read the description and updates at https://precursor.dev

## Glossary of Precursor Project Jargon

To understand the code and documentation in the [Precursor repositories][repos]
on GitHub, it helps to be familiar with the following terms:

- **EC**, short for Embedded Controller, refers to the combination of the iCE40
  FPGA and its gateware configured with a Litex VexRISC-V "[minimal]" RV32I
  core and an SPI controller from [PicoRV32]. EC denotes the place where
  firmware for Precursor's untrusted domain runs. The EC manages battery
  charging and the wifi radio, among other things.
  See [Guided Tour of the Precursor Motherboard][EC].

  [minimal]: https://github.com/betrusted-io/betrusted-ec/blob/d167b75b7127a930e7602ed8d7bf40dec200662f/betrusted_ec.py#L790-L792
  [PicoRV32]: https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32

- **SoC** refers to the combination of the Spartan 7 FPGA and its gateware
  configured with a VexRISC-V RV32IMAC core and crypto accelerators. SoC denotes
  the place where firmware for Precursor's trusted domain runs. The SoC manages
  keyboard input and display output, and it runs OS and application code. See
  [What is a System-on-Chip (SoC), and Why Do We Care if They are Open Source?][SoC]

- **FPC** is short for Flexible Printed Circuit. Precursor uses three flexible
  printed circuits inside the case as cables to connect components. Two FPCs
  connect the display and backlight to the mainboard. Another FPC, sometimes
  referred to as "the FPC", connects the mainboard to GPIO breakout pads,
  battery pads (some mainboard revisions use other battery connectors),
  vibration motor, and speaker. The JTAG debug cable is also an FPC.

- **EVT**, **DVT**, and **PVT** are short for Engineering Validation Test,
  Design Validation Test, and Production Validation Test. EVT, DVT, and PVT are
  often used in the engineering and manufacturing of consumer electronics
  products to denote iterative phases of prototyping. "Test" refers to making a
  design, producing a small batch of prototypes according to that design,
  evaluating the prototypes, then using what was learned to create an improved
  design revision.

  The important thing to understand when looking at Precursor design files on
  GitHub, is that files labeled EVT or DVT are for early design revisions. The
  final, or nearly final, revisions will be labeled PVT. Changes can still
  happen in the PVT phase for reasons like correcting problems with
  manufacturing yield. Photographs of PVT prototypes may not match the final
  PVT design revision that ships to campaign backers. In particular, the final
  production run will have a custom battery pack.

## Hardware Setup

### ðŸ”¥ Battery and FPC Handling Precautions ðŸ”¥

**WARNING**: When handling partially unplugged FPC cable assemblies, be careful
not to short power rail connections on the exposed traces.

1. Some prototype revisions use FPC solder pads for the battery connection. To
   disconnect those batteries, you need to unplug the FPC from the mainboard.
   When you insert or remove the FPC, be sure to keep it pointed straight
   relative to the FPC connector. Orienting the FPC diagonally in the connector
   could short adjacent traces.

2. When an FPC with an attached battery is disconnected from the mainboard,
   **cover the exposed FPC traces with insulating tape.**

3. You will need to remove the keyboard PCB for access to the mainboard FPC
   connector latches. It should be fine to remove or install the keyboard while
   the battery is still connected, just be careful not to short anything on the
   mainboard while handling the keyboard.

4. The JTAG debug cable and USB-C port both connect to power rails on the
   mainboard. When the JTAG cable is connected to the Debug HAT, it is safe to
   also connect USB-C, because the Debug HAT will prevent USB-C power from
   reaching the Raspberry Pi. **But**, if you have the Debug HAT end of the
   JTAG cable disconnected, **cover the exposed FPC traces with insulating
   tape.**
